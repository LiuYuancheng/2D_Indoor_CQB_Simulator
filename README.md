**Program Design Purpose**: 

The use of robots in Close Quarters Battle (CQB) is a significant advancement in modern military and law enforcement tactics. The CQB Robots, with their ability to navigate tight spaces, gather real-time intelligence, and even engage threats, have become valuable assets in these high-stakes scenarios. We want to build a 2D tactical board program (like a computer game) which can load the building floor blue print, CQB squad (robot) position, enemies position, enemy search path for simulating Close-quarters battle (CQB) robot's enemy searching strategy planning and prediction scenario. The tactical board UI is shown below:
